    """ Do astrometry on a FITS image using Astrometry.net.

    Use a local build of the amazing Astrometry.net software [1] in order to
    compute the astrometric solution of a FITS image. This software has many,
    many advantages over the well-respected SCAMP, but the most important one
    is that it is a blind astrometric calibration service. We do not need to
    know literally anything about the image, including approximate coordinates,
    scale and equinox. It just works, giving us a new FITS file containing the
    WCS header.

    In order for this function to work, you must have built and installed the
    Astrometry.net code in your machine [2]. The main high-level command-line
    user interface, 'solve-field', is expected to be available in your PATH;
    otherwise, the AstrometryNetNotInstalled exception is raised. Note that you
    also need to download the appropriate index files, which are considerably
    heavy. At the time of this writing, the entire set of indexes built from
    the 2MASS catalog [4] has a total size of ~32 gigabytes.

    Raises AstrometryNetError if Astrometry.net exits with a non-zero status
    code, AstrometryNetTimeoutExpired if the 'timeout' limit is exceeded and
    AstrometryNetUnsolvedField if the CPU time limit, set in the backend.cfg
    file (by default located in /usr/local/astrometry/etc/) is hit.

    Keyword arguments:

    ra,
    dec,
    radius - restrict the Astrometry.net search to those indexes within
             'radius' degrees of the field center given by ('ra', 'dec').
             Both the right ascension and declination must be given in order
             for this feature to work. The three arguments must be expressed
             in degrees.
    verbosity - the verbosity level. The default value is zero, meaning that
                the function executes silently. A value of one makes both the
                standard output and standard error of Astrometry.net visible.
                Above that, the number of -v flags send to it equals the value
                of the argument minus one. For example: verbosity = 3 allows us
                to see stdout and stderr, and calls Astrometry.net with two -v
                flags. Most of the time, verbosities greater than one are only
                needed for debugging.
    timeout - the maximum number of seconds that Astrometry.net spends on the
              image before giving up and raising AstrometryNetTimeoutExpired.
              Note that the backend configuration file (astrometry.cfg) puts a
              limit on the CPU time that is spent on an image: this can reduce
              that value but not increase it.
    options - a dictionary, containing additional options to be passed to
              solve-field. Each option must map to the corresponding argument
              (for example, {'--downsample' : '2'}), except in case they do not
              take any, when they must map to None (e.g., {'--invert' : None}).
              Both options and values should be given as strings, but they will
              be automatically cast to string just to be safe.
